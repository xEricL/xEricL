### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a 19-year-old software developer and Computer Science student.
My preferred programming language is Python, however, I'll be learning C++ at my university this spring. When I'm not programming, I enjoy doing backend sysadmin work for my company.
