### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a 19-year-old software developer, Computer Science student, as well as a Chairman & Co-Founder of [Crystal Development, LLC](https://github.com/Crystal-Development-LLC).
My preferred programming language is Python, however, I'll be learning C++ at my university this spring. When I'm not programming, I enjoy doing backend sysadmin work for my company.
